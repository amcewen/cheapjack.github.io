### I WALK THE LINE at ULTIMA CONTEMPORARY MUSIC FESTIVAL OSLO


## Oslo Opera, Kirsten Flagstads pl. , Oslo, Norway. 9th September - 11th September 2011

**Glenn Boulter / Sara Christensen / Serina Erfjord / Bob Levene / Kristoffer Myskja / Magnus Oledal / Hans Christian Skovholt / Markus Soukup/ True Solvang Vevatne** 

Curated by Petr Svarovsky (CZ) and Ross Dalziel (UK) exploring contemporary artists notions of space with a focus on sound.

Domestic technology in crisis, DIY space-time experiments with ski jumps; unexpected and half-forgotten elemental forces revealed and made audible from the hum drum of daily life and objects... bubbling containers and miniature dams, stone age sound, psychogeographic walks through hacked 16-bit landscapes and the electrical components that support our networked world re-engineered into endless loops of rhythm.
