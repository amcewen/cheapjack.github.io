**Viewing Area** was a conference for aviation enthusiasts and Plane Spotters at <a href="http://www.terminalconvention.com/about/" title="Terminal Convention website" target="_blank">Terminal Convention</a> an international discursive art event at Cork International Airport, the decommissioned terminal.

**Saturday 19th &amp; Sunday 20th of March 2011**
A mix of artist and plane spotter talks and a 2 day social gathering temporarily gave back an ideal plane spotting viewing platform with cafe and aero-breakfast bar to an active and independent community celebrating aviation.

This event, a conference within a conference aimed to place a sustainable self-contained model of independence for art practice to follow. Self confessed &lsquo;aerosexuals&rsquo; shared their experience with others and also took part in some sociable spotting over coffee tea and cake.
