FAIRGROUND FRAMEWORKS

Fairground Frameworks, is a programme of work that supports work by artists inspired by the fun of the fair, including Simon Jones, Madlab, Kevin Hunt and builds on past research with **Boucny Castle Development Platform** and **Crazy Golf Hack** first commissioned by **Octopus Collective** 

We worked with **Octopus Collective  Liverpool Biennial, Everton Kite Festival, FACT and TATE Liverpool** to show new iterations of interactive crazy golf and Simon Jones *Resonator* a bespoke bouncy castle augmented into a haptic low frequency sound installation

I developed the project for SoundNetwork to support playful spaces for artists to make new work; experiment, prototype and then sustainably tour and build on systems that support their practice and show their work to diverse publics.
