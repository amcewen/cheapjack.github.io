Was drawn to the simplicity of the text of this [Vim Cheat Sheet](http://vim.rtorr.com/) and finding various interesting rabbit holes to export tumblr content into jekyll hosted by github. 
pages.

What I **didnt expect** was a default Disqus Footer! Although very nice had assumed jekyll was just a framework so interesting that this footer is included; I guess github pages is not completely free and Im sure I can turn it off
