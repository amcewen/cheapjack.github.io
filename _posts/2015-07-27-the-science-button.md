### Bookmarking Reality with The Science Button

I met Don Cruickshank at Southampton University who told me about how he manages  all the university labs data that are  hooked up with a range of sensors connected to the internet. They were there to help verifing the starting and ending conditions of experiments so data like humidity, temperature and workbench movement where all available as live data. One of his researchers wanted a 'Science' button. 

The button was a departmental joke:  a big red button with 'science' written on it when pressed just placed a marker in the lab sensor metrics timeline that you might want to 'do science on' ie verify conditions on later. I think the simplicity of that concept would be a good starting point a simple IoT product; a generic button for **bookmarking reality**.

All science is at heart testing simple things and then building up and testing more complex inferences
