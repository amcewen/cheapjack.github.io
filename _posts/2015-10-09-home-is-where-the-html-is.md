### I've recently been documenting alot of stuff on github but then realised I was learning a markup language on top of the most prolific markup language going `html`

Maybe it's my point of entry in learning the underlying tech of the web: I know github markdown more than I know `html` is that weird? In feeling a bit paranoid about this I started to look into what Markdown and `Markup language` [is and where it came from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and it made me feel better. It's all about **Readability**

I think I'm drawn to github as its a way of documenting work and developing it all at the same time and it's to do with laziness; It's difficult to re-visit projects after the fact and document things at that point: the act of doing being self documented totally appeals 

All work on the web is essentially public and putting privacy issues to one side I wonder about an art practice where all the wrong turns, developments, jokes, serious intents, failures and successes are trackable and versioned...

Its also a way of making things more **Readable** I wonder if we put more out there in art practice that is readable and ledgible then we don't end up with work without context that only people with highly specialised language can understand: then again much of tech culture is about developing highly specialised language and systems and that's essential and inevitable to **really build things** .

I think alot of what I do is about translating specialist language into a broader cultural language to explore wider connections. The problem is that sometimes you just make work that re-presents  science and engineering and other specialist knowledge and art becomes purely about a form of public engagement: it's a form of translation but it does not have to completely dumb things down.

My work with the Minecraft of Things is about this: translating interesting things in game as a process of understanding; and a way of exposing how understanding and use-value really work in the world. Minecraft has a wide public perception but also has a very specialised community context, so it's not fully 'the world' it's like a public buffer for it(to re-present a software term). 

I'm especially interested in not just **what** I may (or may not, grr `github`) have learnt but **how** I've learnt technical skills through this process; if I had to learn in a more abstract way then I would learn nothing.
