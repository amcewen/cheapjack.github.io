Successfully launched our prototype #SerialBuoy a design using recycled water bottles found by John O'Shea on instructables. We used Steve Symon&rsquo;s handy <a href="http://www.lprs.co.uk/" title="EasyRadio" target="_blank">EasyRadio</a> module to send basic asci messages from the dockside to an LED flasher onboard and of course Open Source Swan Pedalo to launch it driven by Amanda Steggell, Steven Thorpe and Elisabeth Weihe.</p>
