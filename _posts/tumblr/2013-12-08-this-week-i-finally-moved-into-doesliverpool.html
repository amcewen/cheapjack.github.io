Getting a half tonne LaserScript 1290 Pro laser cutter onto the 4th floor was a minor miracle and could not have done it without the power of Liverpools tech community/mates: Mega props to @wowballsUK @DefProc @mcknut @MethodDan John Ramsey, JR, Hakim @aBookofThings @DoESLiverpool @Defnetmedia for the help, support, problem solving and heavy lifting! @DoeSLiverpool now centre of all things laser in Liverpool City centreâ€¦ &amp; Special thanks to Simon Derwent of Wowballs and Open Source Swan Pedalo fame for driving &amp; finding a temporary home for the Currently bathysphere kit with Grace at the Liverpool Water Sports Centre</p>
