<p>Installing Caller Birds at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.analogueuk.co.uk/">Analogue is the New Digital</a> show at Madlab Edge Street Manchester</p>
<p>Norman Kendall’s Albert Decap Robot Organ was a massive hit of the opening night of the show and AND; with a crowd of people chanting ‘one more song’ as it was pulled down for the night. Really made people smile and talk and attracted curious non-art scene locals from all over the Northern Quarter</p>
<p>The tweetable organ grinder monkey remains in the show responding to @DECAPSOUND #ANDfestival</p>
