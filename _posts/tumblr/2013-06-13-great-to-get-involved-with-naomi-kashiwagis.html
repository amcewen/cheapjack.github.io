I brought along a 4bit (possibly less) crunchy lasercut acrylic bootleg of <a href="http://www.thatfuckingtank.co.uk/">That Fucking Tank&rsquo;s</a> &lsquo;Brucesteenhenge&rsquo; and a micro rumble strip prototype all made with the elegant coding and calculation of <a href="http://www.amandaghassaei.com/about.html" target="_blank">Amanda Ghassaei</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Record/" target="_blank">Instructable</a>. Try it! Must be the most elaborate and useless bootleg of their brilliant work it gets worse each time you play it&hellip;I will have to send them one in tribute to their work with Never Records in Liverpool&hellip;</p>
<p>Then really good to think about other forms of making music physical or the other way round with people like James Medd who showed me his <a href="http://physicalechoes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Physical Echoes</a> project. As usual another brilliant mix of people at Madlab!</p>
