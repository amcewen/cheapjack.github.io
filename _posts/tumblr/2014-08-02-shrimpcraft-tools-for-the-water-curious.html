<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="http://www.octopuscollective.org/" target="_blank">Octopus Collective</a> and <a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/" target="_blank">Natural England</a> to develop a project exploring Walney Island with Year 6 children from North Walney Primary School. It has developed from research with the <a href="http://currently.no" target="_blank">Currently</a> project which aims to get people to engage with the marine world in new ways across different disciplines from sailing, soap making and computer science.<br/><br/>Our approach was for the group to become co-researchers and assemble simple water sensors based on the Arduino platform and use them to explore their environment. As a school on an island the sea and Walney channel is a big part of their world. It would be an opportunity to build and test kits that the school and other schools in the area could use in the future and a way of building on some of the DIY electronics work Octopus have been pioneering in Barrow in Furness based in Piel View House in Barrow Park.</p>

<p>We used <a href="http://shrimping.it" title="Shrimping website" target="_blank">shrimping.it</a> to buy <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/kits/" title="Kits">&lsquo;shrimp core&rsquo; kits</a> with Persistence Of Vision extender kits. Shrimping sell cheap kits and distribute free information on how to build Arduino compatible breadboards for prototyping: they are based locally in Morecambe (hence shrimp) and are all about getting people involved in making more accessible tools; to not just be consumers and be given tools but understand how to build them. You feel more connected to something you have built from components rather than just given a pre built Arduino. It also brings the kit cost down to £10 to make it an affordable project for a class to do. <br/><br/>The school is on an island so like much of Barrow there are strong links to the sea and we wanted to engage children with this environment through collecting artefacts; beachcombing basically, images and also collecting sound and editing together simple soundscapes. For my part of the project we wanted to connect to what you cant see or hear: the underlying data of the environment; what could a computer science take be on exploring the natural world? <br/><br/>I wanted the children to build their own 'computers&rsquo; and sensors and then visualise the data using simple LEDs flashing on the breadboard, a simple <a href="https://www.processing.org/">processing</a> sketch and then draw graphs in minecraft on the FACT server at mc.fact.co.uk as its a space young people are very engaged with. Along the way I wanted to just introduce how you might go about making inferences from the data you collect in the environment; does a certain temperature and muddy water mean the water is healthy? Or do we need water full of useful stuff for animals to live in it?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eLgrcSFNl60/U8RCZWdDohI/AAAAAAAAEJc/hsO0l7Al0DI/w333-h593-no/IMG_20140711_135312065.jpg"/></p>
<p>We made very simplistic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity" title="Turbidity on wikipedia">Turbidity</a> sensors by measuring how much light passed through test-tube samples, and then used DS1820 temperature sensors with the <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire" title="One WIre protocol on arduino playground" target="_blank">1-Wire protocol</a>. In the end we could not get the 1wire stuff working in time but we did get rough analog values that changed with temperature and flashed LEDs in sequence to represent a high or low value. The turbidity sensor was inspired by this brilliant <a href="http://hackteria.org/wiki/DIY_turbidity_meters" target="_blank">Hackteria design</a></p>

<p><br/>We then built rafts to launch out sensors onboard; which really made the sensors come alive<br/><br/>This was a pilot project; we had a lot of great feedback that we need to use to streamline the project: we need to make the shrimp assembly instructions easier and as handouts for everyone and could leave out a lot of components. We also need to incorporate the one-wire library into our code to make the temperature sensors read properly. And finally we need to make templates for recording temperature readings that we made with the flashers.<br/><br/>You can get the prototype pack of processing and python code, CP2102 USB drivers and instruction for shrimp kit assembly <a href="http://soundnetwork.org.uk/misc/cloudmaker/WALNEYSOUNDINGS.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. Theres also a lot of cross curriculum potential in here but it was the first time the school and looked at any technology that you built yourself: and that IT and computers don&rsquo;t have to be software on Windows desktops. A result for me was the obvious delight in getting the arduinos working and calibrating the  flashing LED sequence 'language&rsquo;: If you gave someone a small breadboard with a flashing LED they would not be impressed but because they&rsquo;d built it from scratch and invested meaning and context into it, it had a massive impact!<br/><br/>The next step is to reproduce the workshop with the kits that our co-reseachers help develop for the <a href="http://currently.no" target="_blank">Currently project</a> at Liverpool Maritime Museum with National Museums Liverpool on Saturday 20th August 12 -4 pm with Adrian McEwen and <a href="http://nautilog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Amanda Steggell</a>. We will be adding some improvements and trying out some pH sensors and possibly some radio controlled sensors while also making 'LED throwies&rsquo; to do some morse code <br/><br/></p>
