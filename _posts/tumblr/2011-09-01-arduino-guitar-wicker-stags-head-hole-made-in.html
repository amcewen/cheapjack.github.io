<p>My project for <a href="http://soundnetwork.org.uk">SoundNetwork</a> and <a href="http://www.octopuscollective.org/">Octopus Collective</a> featured an Arduino powered auto-Guitar Stags Head hole made in collaboration with the excellent Chiz Turnross Octopus's FON Festival 2011.</p>

This was a family friendly event allowing artists to playfully hack an existing pitch & putt golf course in Barrow Park and bring out its 'inner' crazy golf course. 

A mix of fun and serious interaction design it allowed artists to learn from each other and collaborate and respond to real world hands on systems like golf courses.
