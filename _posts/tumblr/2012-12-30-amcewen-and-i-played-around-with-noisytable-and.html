<p>We didn&rsquo;t manage a #pingpong rendition of jingle bells but we did play some chords! @mikestubbs brought his kids along for testing purposes later. Plan is to get some fresh solenoids attached to the &lsquo;bellhack bellrack&rsquo; and the code for reading MIDI and serial all packaged up into a usb powered device so we can get it touring wherever #NoisyTable goes in the future.</p>
