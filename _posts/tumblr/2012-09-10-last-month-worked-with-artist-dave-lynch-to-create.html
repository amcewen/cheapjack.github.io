<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_ma4t0aO2VL1r2ybsso1_1280.jpg" width=400><br><br><p>Last month worked with artist Dave Lynch to create <strong>Balloon Vortex</strong> an interactive play space using a series of fans to create a temporary vortex to drive LED embedded weather balloons around Whitehaven civic hall. A kinect tracked the objects and made projection mappings live while families were invited to customise balloons and play with the vortex system accompanied by sound workshops with Octopus.</p>
