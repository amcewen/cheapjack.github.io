###Night of the Living Deadwood

Spent the weekend at [The Night of the Living Deadwood](http://www.andfestival.org.uk/events/night-of-the-living-deadwood/) a workshop organised by AND Festival and [Rod Dillon](https://twitter.com/Sandflyman) exploring the dynamic processes of fungal-tree relationships.

I visited Rod, Jackie and the Micro biology department back in July to think about how Maker and Hackspace cultures and game cultures like Minecraft could be used as approaches to both public engagement and teaching micro biology and research areas like Biological Computation and [Quorum Sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_sensing)  

####Symbiotic Selfies

We began with a funghal/bacteria microscopy 101 in the Forestry Commission Office of Grizedale Forest and spent the weekend collecting samples and images, worrying about anthropormorphic language and signs, observing 3-way Spore sex, Mycorrhizal funghal networks, meditating, Minecrafting Bacterial hyphae landscapes and walking the Forest hills for mesh networked whistling scultptures.

####Our bodies are not our own: The convenience of language in the presence of god-like massive eco-systems

Im always amazed by how thinking of "My Body" and "A Tree" as distinct entities inadequatly describes what we **really** are; vast communities of multi and single cellular autonomous organisms changing communicating and reproducing over millenia and every second that we are alive (or dead). Like any way of thinking, simple representational objects are useful and convenient before building up to more complex models: the signs of the alphabet (getting all Marshall McLuhen here) are very simple yet we can translate them so fast we can build very complex things from there...

###The body and the forest: Funghal infrastructure

Slime Moulds are convenient organisms; they are prolific, hardy and easy to inoculate and culture. I liked Jackie Parry's reply to the question *"Why Slime Moulds?"*, that it was probably just an easy thing to do and when other scientists saw it they all started using them. So they kind of seem to be like a biological prototyping and testing tool

##Mapping CMN networks with bio luminescent enzyme markers

Bio-luminescent bacteria and enzymes make convenient markers

The Rhizomatic Funghal network: The natural vector of these bacteria is in the forest and soil ecosystem: but Rod had a packet of it he bought on Amazon and I wondered How are human supply chains and the gardening shopping networks of Amazon and EBay be used as new vectors for spreading and delivering DNA...

####Is it useful to model these networks?

This workshop has coloured my entire festival experience and Im seeing everything in terms of inter-connected networks: now every artist seem to be acting out or re-presenting broader network models; whether that was a curatorial intent I dont know: Im seeing Bacteria everywhere now.

####Festivals as Havens 

AND felt like a retreat into a haven for exploring and thinking and making art with technology; but also about making it in the landscape and not just in the city and to deal with different scales. It echoed myself and Markus Brinkmann's thoughts of getting away from **Festivals** and **labs** and instead thinking about **havens**, springing from thinking about hackspaces as havens for knowledge and people. Havens imply more sustained research and exploration and space for reflection/renewal; and DeadWood was a great example of that as is the ongoin work with Rod & his team at BLS in Lancaster.


#Day 2

##Language Problems

###Biosemiotic detour

Started off day 2 getting embroiled in language issues; when we say 'communicating' in context of plant life its not quite the same as what we think of in the human world. As a group we started to acknowledge the semiotics of it all but I thought what was important about thinking of that; exactly how are we applying language and whether art is 'beyond lanuguage', is an **awareness** of the anthropocentric impulse and likewise the impulse to say *'Oh slime mould is like an arduino or this Mycorrhizal fungi network is like the internet'* 

Clearly theres an area of philosophy to explore here for sure but there's a danger that if you start to feel a clear philosophical framework is a requirement to give you a space to work in then it's hard to get anywhere.

Jackie's thought of a way to think of the difference in thinking of 'communiciation': describing a cloud appearing on the horizon as a packet of information you receive and respond to: "Oh its going to Rain". Although you could receive it as information it does not mean it **has been sent to you** necessarily.

####Quantum RNA

Ive been reading **Teranesia** by Greg Egan about a viral RNA protein that uses quantum inconsistencies in its structure to mutate and adapt across parrallel quantum histories in time; communicating across genetic timelines. It's pretty out there but it also contains a surprising sustained rant about the real value to humanity of obscure cultural theory and bio-semiotics and it's value in the future of 'science'.

####Meditation cd's

Thiago Hersan talked about making meditation tracks to **feel** the masses of bacterial communication in our bodies and relating it to the forest's own information super-highway. And then we all took part in a meditation exercise prototype on the floor before learning how to take microscope pictures with Smartphones...

##Making & Looking

I made a Pop-Up Minecraft:Pocket Edition server on an Android phone with bacterial microscopy images turned into landscapes you can explore in-game while physically exploring a forest.

I've made a [DeadWood Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cheapjack/DeadWood) which explains the making side in more detail and includes images from the weekend

I think I will continue using game culture as a framework for exploring micro biology so Jackie Parry and I will be making

 * Slow - PacMan: using amoebas and other single/multicellular organisms to simulate classics from Game Culture and challenge a human player to compete with the microscopic cultures that make everything work and without which we would never have made any tools in the first place...
