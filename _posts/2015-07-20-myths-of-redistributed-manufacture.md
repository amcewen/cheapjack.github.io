## Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing Symposium

I'm at an RCA symposium exploring Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing  I'm interested in the sudden interest in harnassing maker communities and related 'enthusiasts': These are my notes on the speakers and thought exercises. 

5 million RaspPI
10K Arduino a month

How will this plateau out and impact on the future of invention: there is a surface tier that is extremely wide and broad and then a lesser known clowdy dark matter tier.

Are there suspect motives behind it?

**"Utilising MakerFaires/Maker-ness"** 

#### Barcelona

Tensions between the 'community' and what funders want

Case by case is important

Maintaining diversity

### Dark Matter of Maker Spaces

Clumping

The thing about 

Are makerspaces really designed? Should they be? Relationships to hackerspace culture

We want to Redistibute Manufacturing but we dont want to **run** redistributed manufacture in the NorthWest

Support the community not absorb or control it.

Access and sector the Dark Matter of Venn Diagrams

#### There is no easy win to dark matter issues;

The main thing about it is we cant see it easily that's why we use the metaphor:
Dangers are cultural gestures and cultural visibility...

### Can we really scale?

Hiding Manufacturing from the Makerspaces to engage What is local?

Sounds like we need established manufacturing services in order for them to run the smaller manufacturing models that allows people to order 10 circuit boards. 

Need high volume to float the low volume and bespoke.

Allow a smaller business model to exist within a bigger one

## Good & Bad

### Ethics of home manufacturing and "Maker Movements in the home" Who will ruthlessly exploit the *material* of 'Maker-ness' 

### Reverse Engineering the Gulf Stream

Open Knowledge versus 'new transacitional methodologies'

Andiamo

Service designers

"develop orthotics for people within 1 week globally"

Naveed looking at software to enable printing of orthotics

Demand and capacity gaps and clinical evidence gap

**Industrial led culture leads and inhibits/inhabits everything**

### Half-Cut Stack: not the full stack? Not useful for everything...


Material science in additive manufacturing is very poor... FDA in America is still the main regulator
Service Design is poor: Look at OnShape

Empathy can create radical disruption

Danger of throwing hyped tech and methodologies at things.

Not individuals at all its multi disciplinary teams distributed non-linear
The Cox Review
`STEM >> STEAM`

Go in for one thing and have completely unrelated inspiring conversation about something else

What is an innovation space? Experience of being approached by 2 designers in MakerFaire about how to design stuff; I just gave completely conflicting advice! Wanting your cake and eating it but also cooking it and assembling the cooker element.

### Critical Bolt holes for innovation and play 

Made me think on [Markus Brinkmann](http://blog.marcus-brinkmann.de/)'s idea of hackerspaces as Havens for people and/with knowledge from our [PublicEngineering Project](http://wiki.doesliverpool.com/PublicEngineering) which I blogged about [here](http://cheapjack.github.io/2014/06/18/publicengineering-is-a-response-to-bochum-in-the/)



Critical of over-hype in co-design but clearly we are all really focussed on Co-Designing with families
Critical of imagination without restraint but then focussed on imagination?
Critical of gestural provocations but then always bringing it back to one
