[Bring and Byte](http://bringandbyte.co.uk) was a music hackathon weekend made for The Hub UK. I curated the technical people and generally engineered things with the brilliant Jenny Harris and Julia Payne

It aimed to look at ways to fix the independent music industry and help develop revenue streams , develop younger audiences and increase footfall. We did this through crowdsourced and self mmanaged bandstand programming with **BoomStand**, an app for wilfully obscure hipsters **Wankr**, interactive printed books, RFID audience tracking **GigCard** and a device for destroying online music and degrading live performances depending on how many people were trying to record the gig on their phones instead of **watching the bloody gig**.
