[Bring and Byte](http://bringandbyte.co.uk) was a music hackathon weekend made for [The Hub UK](http://thehubuk.com/). 

I curated the technical people and generally engineered things with the brilliant Jenny Harris and Julia Payne


It aimed to find ways to 'fix' the independent music industry through a mix of hackathon and co-design to help sustain revenue streams , develop younger audiences and increase footfall. 

We did this through crowdsourced and self mmanaged bandstand programming with [BoomStand](https://twitter.com/weareboomstand), an app for wilfully obscure hipsters **Wankr**, interactive printed books, RFID audience tracking **GigCard** and a device for destroying online music and degrading live performances depending on how many people were trying to record the gig on their phones instead of **watching the bloody gig**
