I'm an artist who sets up activity, events & systems to explore how knowledge is produced and shared. This is my current website hosted on github pages.
<br>
<br>Alot of my work engages with a place or subject and then explores it by bringing together an often trans-discipline mix of people and collaborators.
<br><br>
I'm also interested in infrastructure; everything we make is built on something someone else has made or thought of. There's a critical history inside every tool we use, conceptual or technical. 
<br><h2>Some thoughts on tools</h2>

<br>This website is built on `Jekyll-Bootstrap` and hosted for free on github pages; and like most things we use all built on other peoples hard work. The content was previously on Tumblr, someone else's hard work. I love Tumblr but wanted the option to place the content in a different form.
<br>

<br>I like to celebrate the tools and knowledge we use to be creative. I'm consistently interested in who's knowledge we use and why. The use of tools is a connection to a wider community of knowledge beyond our individual experience and expression.

<br> Much of my intent curatorially is to refer back and engage with the knowledge I aquire and profit from.
